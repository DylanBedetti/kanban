# How to run locally?

# TO DO

- [ ] Define database schema
- [ ] Build Routes
- [ ] Create all CRUD methods
- [ ] Test backend with Postman
- [ ] Deploy database to AWS? or keep locally? do both?
- [ ] Add stickers to project

# Questions

- Header.js -> why does this work (e, { name, path }), but not this ({ name, path })????
- How to think about mapping database schema to REST API? Should be thinking more about what the frontend will want to request / how user will use the app? Do I want a route for every table for CRUD operations?
- is this a legit URI: postgres://${user}:${password}@${host}:${port}/${database}? whats the go with postgres://
