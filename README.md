# Questions

- **frontend** &#8594; Header.js -> why does this work (e, { name, path }), but not this ({ name, path })????
- **database** &#8594; How to think about mapping database schema to REST API? Should be thinking more about what the frontend will want to request / how user will use the app? Do I want a route for every table for CRUD operations?
- **database** &#8594; is this a legit URI: postgres://${user}:${password}@${host}:${port}/${database}? whats the go with postgres://
- **database** &#8594; direction of database associations? a comment has a single user, or a user has many comments? which table to define assocations?
- **database** &#8594; Should I be using UUID's or just incrementing ids to unique define rows?
